# 🚀 Production Deployment Guide - Email-Enabled Amway 4 Basics

## 📋 Overview

This guide helps you deploy the production version with **real email functionality** for password resets.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### 1. Email Service Setup
Choose one of these email services:

#### Option A: Gmail (Recommended for small teams)
- Gmail account with **2FA enabled**
- Generate **App Password**: Google Account → Security → App Passwords
- Note: Gmail has daily sending limits (500 emails/day)

#### Option B: SendGrid (Recommended for larger teams)
- Create account at https://sendgrid.com
- Get API key from dashboard
- Higher sending limits and better deliverability

## 🌐 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Prepare Files
Upload these files to your GitHub repository:
```
├── index.html (main app with login)
├── reset.html (password reset page)
├── netlify.toml (configuration)
├── package.json (dependencies)
└── netlify/
    └── functions/
        └── reset-password.js (email function)
```

#### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify
1. **Go to https://netlify.com**
2. **Connect GitHub repository**
3. **Deploy settings:**
   - Build command: `npm install`
   - Publish directory: `/`

#### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
In Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables:

**For Gmail:**
```
EMAIL_USER = your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS = your-app-password-here
SITE_URL = https://your-site.netlify.app
```

**For SendGrid:**
```
SENDGRID_API_KEY = your-sendgrid-api-key
EMAIL_FROM = noreply@yourdomain.com
SITE_URL = https://your-site.netlify.app
```

#### Step 4: Test Production Email
1. Visit your live site
2. Click "Forgot Password"
3. Enter email address
4. Check inbox for reset email

### Option 2: Vercel

#### Setup:
1. **Go to https://vercel.com**
2. **Import GitHub repository**
3. **Add environment variables** (same as Netlify)
4. **Deploy automatically**

---

### Option 3: Custom Backend

#### For advanced users wanting more control:

1. **Node.js + Express server**
2. **Database integration** (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
3. **Advanced email templates**
4. **User management dashboard**

## 📧 Email Configuration Examples

### Gmail Setup (netlify/functions/reset-password.js):
```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS // App Password, not regular password
  }
});
```

### SendGrid Setup:
```javascript
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

const msg = {
  to: email,
  from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM,
  subject: 'Password Reset - Amway 4 Basics',
  html: emailTemplate
};

await sgMail.send(msg);
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables
- ✅ Never commit email credentials to GitHub
- ✅ Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- ✅ Use app passwords, not regular passwords

### 2. Reset Tokens
- ✅ Generate secure random tokens
- ✅ Set expiration time (1 hour recommended)
- ✅ Store tokens securely (database in production)

### 3. Rate Limiting
```javascript
// Add to function to prevent abuse
const rateLimit = {
  window: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 5 // 5 requests per window
};
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Local Development:

### Production Testing:
- [ ] Email service configured correctly
- [ ] Reset emails deliver to inbox (check spam)
- [ ] Reset links work and expire properly
- [ ] Form validation works on all devices
- [ ] SSL certificate is active

## 📱 Production Features

### ✅ What Works:
- **Real email delivery** for password resets
- **Secure token-based** reset system
- **Professional email templates** with branding

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending:
1. **Check environment variables** in hosting platform
2. **Verify email service** credentials
3. **Check spam folder** for test emails
4. **Review function logs** in Netlify/Vercel dashboard

### Reset Links Not Working:
1. **Verify SITE_URL** environment variable
2. **Check token generation** logic
3. **Ensure reset.html** is accessible

### Common Errors:
```
Error 535: Authentication failed
→ Check email credentials and app password

→ Verify recipient email address exists

Timeout errors
→ Check network connectivity and email service status
```
